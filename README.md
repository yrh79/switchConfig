# Count Down Switch Configuratior
A GUI to configure the count down switch device I designed.

## Description
This is a helper project for the project https://github.com/yrh79/count_down_switch_serial_config project, which sends commands to set the configuration of the count_down_switch via serial ports.

This is a GUI written in python. I'll make it a windows executable later on.

The application would try to discover the correct comport to use automatically.

Note: Ramdom crash is found, reason unknown yet. I'll try to figure out the reason and get it fix later on.
