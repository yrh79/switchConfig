# Count Down Switch Configuratior
A GUI to configure the count down switch device I designed.

## Description
This is a helper project for the project https://github.com/yrh79/count_down_switch_serial_config project, which sends commands to set the configuration of the count_down_switch via serial ports.

This is a GUI written in python. I'll make it a windows executable later on.

Note: this is not a complete and workable program yet. If you wish to use it, please wait a little bit. I push it here just to make it easier to move around across my different development computers. :)

It is functional but lack of the ability to automatically select the correct COM port to use. It'll be implemented later on. Please wait.
